# PLONK

In this document, we present an in-depth analysis of PLONK and the specific version that has been implemented in Lambdaworks. Additionally, we provide a step-by-step guide on how to utilize our high-level API, which is designed to simplify the user experience.

Our version of PLONK is heavily inspired by [gnark](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark). We would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to ConsenSys for generously sharing their source code with the community.

We have written this document with the aim of making it accessible to both novice and advanced users. So, whether you're a newcomer to PLONK or an experienced user, you will find this document to be a valuable resource.
